## Tests

### CPU i7-5600U, 8 GB ram, CPU load measurements using btop on Ubuntu

The 7-segment font counters are updating flat out with every screen redraw (probably 60 Hz).

Compiled as ```--release```.

* 600 spinners: Window minimized, CPU = 0.3-0.6%
* 1 spinner: Window maximized, CPU = 17-18%, this high CPU load will be due to the 7-segments updating
* 600 spinners: Window maximized, CPU = 17-19%, 7-segments updating
* 0 spinners: Window maximized, CPU = 0.2-2%, 7-segments not shown
* 0 spinners: Window maximized, CPU = 0.2-0.5%, 7-segments shown but not being refreshed since the display is static
* 0 spinners: Window maximized, CPU = 17-18%, 7-segments updating due to mouse cursor movment

## Notes
- Fonts are from fonts.google.com.
